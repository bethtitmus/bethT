    		        <h2>What is VR? </h2>
    	            <p> 
    					VR or Virtual reality is using a computer to create a simulated enviorment.
    	                unlike traditional user interfaces, VR places the user inside of the experience.
    	                this makes it feel real for them and they can interact with the 3D worlds.	
    	                we do this by simulation as many senses as possible. such as vision, hearing, touch, and maybe even smell.

    	            <p> 
    					In this photo there is a man using a VR headset and handset,this is used for the people to enter the simulated enviorment.
    	                This makes it so the player can't see anything other than the environment and they can also hear and interact with it.

    		        <h2>What is AR?</h2>
    
    	             <p> 
    					Virtual reality and Augmented reality are two sides of the same coin.
    	                This is because augmented reality is similar but involves more of the real world
    	                Augmented reality simulates artificial objects into real environments.
                        Augmented reality will normally use a camera to make this possible letting you see computer-generated things in the real world.
    	                This is diffrent from the completely computer made enviormennt.</p>
    	            <div class="img-container">
    	            	<img src="image/arpc.jpg" alt="Pokemon on computer AR example">
    	            </div>
    	            <p>In this photo is shows AR in action, this means most of the content is based in the real world, while a small portaion is 
    					based in agumented reality. This means people can use this for anything such as games, promotional uses and even eduactional.
